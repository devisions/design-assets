## Additional Icons

These are some additional icons for [Material-Black-Pistachio-Suru](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1333360/) icon theme.

Notes:
- Zoom 
  - it stores two icons in `/usr/share/pixmaps` directory: `Zoom.png` and `application-x-zoom.png`.
  - change them with the one that I have it in this location, even ran a `sudo gtk-update-icon-cache` but no change yet.
