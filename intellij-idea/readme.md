## IntelliJ IDEA > Design Assets

My IntelliJ (maybe not IDEA specific) related design artifacts.

Currently, I am using `Material Solarized Dark` theme provided by [Material Theme UI plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui/) with a custom version of `Solarized Dark (4lex)` color scheme that comes with [Solarized Themes plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui/).
