## IntelliJ IDEA > Design Assets

My IntelliJ (maybe not IDEA specific) related design artifacts.

Currently, I am using:
- `Material Solarized Dark` theme provided by [Material Theme UI plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui/)
- with a custom version of `Solarized Dark (4lex)` color scheme that comes with [Solarized Themes plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui/)<br/>saved here (exported) as `devisions - Solarized Dark (4lex4).icls` file.

Zsh related settings should be available in [oh-my-zsh](../oh-my-zsh) folder of this repo.
