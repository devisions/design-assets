Used the ALT-oriented key shortcuts (to mimick the macOS layout, where CMD (instead of ALT) is near the SPACE).

Therefore, here are the main shortcuts:

- `ALT+1` to show the Explorer view
- `ALT+2` to show the Search view
- `ALT+3` to show the Source Control view
- `ALT+4` to show the Run & Debug view
- `ALT+5` to show the Extensions view

- `ALT+b` to toggle the sidebar visibility
