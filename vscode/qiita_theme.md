## Qiita Theme > My Settings

Although the Qiita's status bar background looks very fresh, I switched the background and foreground to minimize the visual impact. See below the settings (including the debugging related colors):

```json
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "statusBar.background": "#374549",
        "statusBar.foreground": "#54c62a",
        "statusBar.debuggingBackground": "#374549",
        "statusBar.debuggingForeground": "#C6A82A",
    },

```

And the result is:
