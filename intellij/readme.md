### 2020-04-20 | MatCustThemeSolarDark

Still using a custom green influenced version of Material Custom Theme saved in [devisions - MatCustThemeSolarDark](./devisions%20-%20MatCustThemeSolarDark/).

### Status

Currently, I am using:

-   `Material Solarized Dark` theme provided by [Material Theme UI plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui/)
-   with a custom version of `Solarized Dark (4lex)` color scheme that comes with [Solarized Themes plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui/)<br/>saved here (exported) as `devisions - Solarized Dark (4lex4).icls` file.

Zsh related settings should be available in [oh-my-zsh](../oh-my-zsh) folder of this repo.
